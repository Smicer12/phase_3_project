### Business Problem Understanding
#### Introduction
The world has recently experienced the impact of major flu outbreaks like the COVID-19, Swine Flu (H1N1) and the Avian Flu(H5N1). The effect of any flu outbreak depends on the type of flu and its respective variants, the population demographics like age, and other underlying health conditions of the individual. In the US, seasonal flu places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9 million – 41 million illnesses, 140,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 – 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020. The results obtained from CDC website also shows that the vaccination rates have remained low with an overall average of 57.8% as of 2022.

Despite the availability and effectiveness of flu vaccines, there are still significant portions of the population who choose not to get vaccinated. To address this problem, it is crucial to investigate the reasons behind these decisions and identify the key factors driving individuals' opinions, perceptions, and behaviors related to flu vaccination.

### Business goals
The project aims to analyze and uncover the factors that influence individuals' decision-making processes regarding getting vaccinated against the seasonal flu. By gaining insights into these factors,governments and healthcare organizations can develop targeted strategies and interventions to increase vaccination rates and improve public health outcomes.

### Project goals
The objective of this project is to understand how the following factors affect H1N1 & Seasonal flu vaccination rates.
* Opinions & Perceptions
* Demographics - Age, Education, Employment status & Income levels iii) Behavioral - Handwashing, masking and avoiding large crowds.
